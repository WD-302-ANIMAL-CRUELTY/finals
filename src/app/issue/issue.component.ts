Often times we always forget that the items we use on a daily basis might have been tested on animals. Most frequently used are mice, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs which can cause irritations to severe damages or even worseâ€“death. Although humans can benefit from successful animal research, the pain and death of animals are not worth the possible human benefits. ";
