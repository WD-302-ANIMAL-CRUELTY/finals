<p>10 CRUELTY-FREE FILIPINO BEAUTY BRANDS</p>
<h2>The Humane Society of the United States released a docu-style short film titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G393z8s8nFY">Save Ralph</a> in April. The video quickly went viral, drawing attention to the horrors of 
  animal testing through the character Ralph, a bunny who has suffered multiple injuries as a result of his "job." With over 11 million views on YouTube, the film sparked a 
  worldwide animal rights movement, increasing demand for cruelty-free products. <br>
  <br>
  Fortunately, these aren't difficult to come by in your area. Long before the now-popular short film 
  was even shared, a slew of Filipino beauty brands pledged to be cruelty-free. If you've been considering 
  donating to this cause, keep reading for a list of ten cruelty-free beauty brands and their must-have products.</h2>
